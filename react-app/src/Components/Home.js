       The ol' reliable Toyota running gear giving classics a new lease on life, and this particular fiat just might be one of the very first restomods in Dhaka, done by Akbar A Sattar. This little fiat sits comically beside some of its larger American siblings inside its stable. Turbocharged Toyota 4E-FTE mated to an automatic has enough firepower, while the rally-style O.Z wheels are undoubtedly the most excellent modification on this restomod.

        The Toyota sourced six-cylinder naturally aspirated 2JZ found underneath both these W123s have a nice throaty grunt on the wide open throttle, all the while being yet another unholy axis of collaboration between the Germans and the Japanese. While the red 280E is flashy, the silver-green paint on the 230 with the period-correct bundt wheels is to die for.

        Toyota JZ power inside much older metal. Undoubtedly the best variation of the British ford zephyr from the late 50s, the car once upon a time belonged to the late car collector extraordinaire EM Faruq. However, the brain behind the extraordinary restoration project is Abrar Musa. The candy red is delicious, not that we had a lick of it.

        What started life as a series 3 fire truck employed by the government now lives its life as a summer/winter cruiser, with a backdated series 2A face. Just don't get inside when it's raining outside. This vehicle also belongs to Abrar Musa.
